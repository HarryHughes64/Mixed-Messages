## General Information
- This is a very simple Node.js project to generate a single randomised message.
- This is to demonstrate the use of GitHub, and creating my first project in my own development environment.



## Technologies Used
- Node.js - v14.17.5


## Features
- Generates random message

## Setup
Within '/c/Dev Projects/Mixed Messages' you will find script.js. Open script.js in a code editor of your choice. 

Within your terminal run 'node script.js' to view the random message in your terminal.


## Usage
How does one go about using it?
Provide various use cases and code examples here.

`function randomNumberGenerator` to generate random number.

`const wisdomMessages` stores the parts of the messages.

`let finalMessage` completes and stores the final message as an array.



## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 


## Room for Improvement


- Log the message as one single string, rather than 3 seperate strings. HI




## Acknowledgements

- This project was inspired by a similar project on Codecademy.
